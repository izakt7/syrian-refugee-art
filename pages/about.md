## Syrian Refugee Art Exhibition

This digital exhibition showcases works by artists who have documented and expressed the experiences of displacement, resilience, and hope in the context of the Syrian refugee crisis. Through paintings, photographs, installations, and multimedia works, these artists transform personal and collective suffering into art that demands our attention, empathy, and action.
