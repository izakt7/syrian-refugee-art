The journey of displacement is one of the central themes in Syrian refugee art. Artists capture the harrowing experiences of leaving home—the dangerous crossings, the uncertainty, the loss. These works bear witness to the millions who have been forced to flee, documenting both the physical journey and the emotional toll of displacement.

Through powerful imagery and symbolism, these artworks tell stories that statistics cannot convey. They show the human faces behind the numbers, the individual experiences within the collective crisis. Each piece serves as a testament to resilience, documenting not just the trauma of displacement but also the determination to survive and rebuild.

   content="This artwork from Helen Zughaib's Syrian Migration Series depicts the dangerous journey many refugees undertook, paying smugglers to transport them on overcrowded boats. Many of these vessels sank, resulting in tragic loss of life. The artwork serves as a powerful reminder of the desperate measures people take when fleeing conflict." %}


The artworks in this exhibit explore the physical and emotional dimensions of migration. From the dangerous sea crossings to the long waits in refugee camps, artists document every stage of the journey. These works remind us that behind every statistic is a human story—a family separated, a home left behind, a future uncertain.

As we view these works, we are called to recognize our shared humanity and our responsibility to support those who have been forced to flee. Art becomes a bridge between the experiences of refugees and those who have the privilege of safety and stability.
